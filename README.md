# ANOMALY-DETECTION-IN-TIME-SERIES-DATA-OF-NEW-YORK-CITY-TAXI-DEMAND

Finding anomalies in the New York City Taxi Demand dataset is the goal of this 
project. The NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission is the source of the dataset, 
which offers a detailed account of all taxi passengers combined into 30-minute 
blocks. The dataset is notable for having anomalies associated with significant 
occasions like the NYC Marathon, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's Day, 
and a snowfall. An essential component of data analysis is anomaly detection, 
which makes it possible to spot odd trends or occurrences that greatly depart from 
the norm. Understanding and spotting abnormalities in the context of taxi demand 
is crucial for maximizing resource allocation and service scheduling.
 In order to find anomalies in the taxi demand dataset, this 
project uses a machine learning technique called the Isolation Forest algorithm. 
The Isolation Forest works well in situations where anomalies are distinct and 
uncommon, and it is especially useful for finding outliers in large datasets. The 
report will examine each step of the project, including feature engineering, data 
exploration, preprocessing, training the model, and anomaly visualization. By the 
project's conclusion, we hope to shed light on the temporal trends in New York 
City's taxi demand and draw attention to unusual occurrences that have a big 
influence on passenger volumes.
